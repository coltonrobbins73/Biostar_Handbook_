Bioinformatics is a broad multi-disciplinary computational field that seeks to understand the information stored within living systems. Subfields include but are not limited to:

1. **Classification** : species composition within a population.
2. **Assembly** : establishing the nucleotide composition of genomes.
3. **Resequencing** : identifying mutations and variations in genomes.
3. **Quantification** : measuring functional characteristics of a cell.

### How to be a successful bioinformatician

Massive amounts of data and computation are necessary for bioinformatics analysis which can be time-consuming and difficult to interpret. Thus, when designing a new analysis pipeline, it is critical to start with a small subset of data to iterate quickly and to track how different components are being transformed. Flexibility and robustness are the most important elements initially.

### DNA properties

DNA is composed of four distinct nucleotides that are assembled as a pair of long molecular chains. These chains are bound to one another in a helical structure using complimentary base pair hydrogen bonds. The two chains are packaged using various proteins into a large structure called a chromosome. The two chains are arbitrarily labeled either forward or reverse strands as a conventional understanding. Note that sense and anti-sense should not be confused with forward and reverse nomenclature as sense and anti-sense labeling is determined by the functional sequencing direction of a DNA element and is used for both forward and reverse strands.
